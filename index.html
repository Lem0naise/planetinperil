                    As the challenges of the climate crisis become ever clearer, we are also facing a biodiversity crisis. Population of mammals have declined by 56%, birds by 54%, insects by 54%, and fishes by 41% over the last 50 years. At least 10,000 species are going extinct each year.

                        Our ecosystem is an intricate web of connections between prey and predator, plants, animals, fungi - and of course humans too. Tug the web by removing one species, and the consequences will be devastating for other species too. Like a giant game of jenga, if one block is removed, others may come unexpectedly tumbling down.<br/><br/>
                        Each block is hand-painted with eight animals or plants. An accompanying booklet contains interesting facts on each species.<br/><br/>
                        Which insects or fungi have you heard of?<br/>
                        Do you know if they are endangered or not?<br/>
                        Where do they live?<br/>

                        Loosely based on Snakes and Ladders, this game is equally frustrating! Players move towards either a hotter, more damaged Earth, or a cooler, pleasant Earth, encountering different government and corporate policies along the way.

                        A fun introduction to the idea that government and business decisions are crucial to helping our environment alongside the individual actions which children are more familiar with.

The warming stripes show clearly and vividly how global average temperatures have risen over nearly two centuries.” </p>          <p class="p">Professor Ed Hawkins, University of Reading.

                        The warming stripes are an image that children will become increasingly familiar with - it's even being worm by Reading FC as part of their football kit - but do they know exactly what the stripes mean?
                        <br/><br/>
                        this activity will help them to understand and to explain the graphic, and they can also explpore Warming Stripes for different cities or countries using the University of Reading website.

                        If you can name something, then in a small way it becomes part of you, and you may be more likely to take notice of it, to care for it.

                        In the game of Dominio Danger, smaller dominoes get knocked down by each Tipping Point to show the students the real-life impacts on humans and other species.

                    I am a part-time primary school teacher, with experience of teaching both teaching KS1 and KS2, based in SW London. I love to combine the science from my Geography Degree with my passion for art to create games which invite children to think about the beauty of our planet.
